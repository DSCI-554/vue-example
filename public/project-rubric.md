### Presentation

Presentation__ students will present their projects to the class using the [PechaKucha](http://www.pechakucha.org) presentation format. PechaKucha is a simple presentation format where you show *10 images, each for 20 seconds*. The images advance automatically and you talk along to the images. You cannot use bullets in any of your slides. The presentation will be created with [Sozi](http://sozi.baierouge.fr). Presentations should include the following:

- Cover slide (used to start the presentation manually, not included in time) including title, group name, names and emails
- Introduction leading with 10 words on what your visualization is about. Explain who is it addressed to, why it is interesting, original, useful.
- Explain who did what.
- Explain the data and topic as needed to understand the project.
- Explain the research you have done, what others have done in the same topic, other topics that are relevant.
- Explain how your work is original.
- Explain your design process, rationale for the layout, story, choice of forms, how you optimized the visual queries and user interaction.
- Highlight what you have built and with d3 (see Demonstration for a list of required d3 features to include) and other tools including Bootstrap and framework features you used.
- Explain what you would have done differently.

Use Markdown to create a transcript of your presentation in a file named `PRESENTATION_TRANSCRIPT.md`. Make sure to provide a link in the `README.md` as described in Development.

### Paper

Students should write a research paper about their project as if they were submitting it to a conference for publication. The paper should follow the [LNCS format](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0), be at most 5 pages long, and include sections on the **introduction, data, approach** (including design, technical considerations, development, and evaluation), **system, related work, conclusions,** and **references**. Each paper should be clearly written, concise, and organized professionally. **Overleaf** is required for writing the paper, and students may also link the paper on their project website if they choose.

| **Clarity of Exposition**     | The paper is exceptionally clear, concise, and logically organized. Language is professional and effectively communicates complex ideas. Figures, tables, and captions are well-integrated and enhance comprehension.                                                     | The paper is understandable but may lack conciseness or logical flow. Language is generally clear but may include minor issues. Figures and tables are present but may not fully support the text. | The paper is difficult to follow, poorly organized, and contains multiple unclear sentences. Figures and tables may be missing or confusing.                                       |
| **Quality of References**     | Relevant, high-quality references are used to support the project, providing strong connections to existing research. All references are properly cited in LNCS format.                                                                                                   | References are present but may lack relevance or completeness. Some formatting errors are present.                                                                                                 | References are minimal or inappropriate. Significant formatting errors are present, showing little attention to citation guidelines.                                               |
| **Method**                    | The approach section provides a thorough description of the methods and rationale, clearly explaining design decisions and technical considerations. Development and evaluation processes are detailed and demonstrate an understanding of data visualization principles. | The approach section is present but lacks depth in explaining design or technical considerations. Development and evaluation are described but may lack clarity.                                   | Methods are vaguely described or missing, with limited explanation of design and technical aspects. The section does not demonstrate an understanding of visualization principles. |
| **Experiment and Validation** | Experiments are well-designed, with appropriate analysis of results. Validation is thorough, and results are presented with clarity and critical reflection on findings and limitations.                                                                                  | Experiments and validation are present but may lack rigor or depth. Results are described but lack detailed analysis.                                                                              | Experiments and validation are minimal or missing, with little to no analysis of results. Findings may lack relevance or be unclear.                                               |

### Video

Students should produce a 5-minute (or less) video of their demo and upload it to YouTube. The video should present the most important aspects of the project and demonstrate the most important features. Optionally, the video can be integrated in the website.
