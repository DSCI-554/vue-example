# DSCI 554 Group Project

## Description

In this final project, you will create a comprehensive data visualization demo paper as a conference submission. The goal is to design an interactive visualization system or tool that addresses a unique data-driven problem. This project aims to showcase the application of visualization principles and techniques learned in class to provide a solution to a problem. 

### Deliverables

- Paper
- Demonstration 
- Presentation
- Video

### Requirements

- Using Git for version control.
- One of React, Vue.js, or Streamlit is well utilized.
- All pages are well laid out and use Bootstrap.
- All pages and at least one chart are responsive.
- Final product is deployed and publicly accessible (see deployment examples for instructions).
- README.md is updated with the requested information

## Rubric

Students are expected to submit:

1. A research paper about their project as if they were submitting it to a conference for publication. The paper should follow the [LNCS format](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0), be at most 8 pages long, and include sections on the **introduction, data, approach** (including design, technical considerations, development, and evaluation), **system, related work, conclusions,** and **references**. Each paper should be clearly written, concise, and organized professionally. **Overleaf** is required to write the paper. 
2. A link to the deployed system. Please see the following examples for instructions:
    - [Streamlit](https://dsci-554.streamlit.app/) : [GitHub](https://github.com/dsci-554/streamlit-example)
    - [Vue](https://dsci-554.github.io/vue-example) : [Github](https://github.com/dsci-554/vue-example)
    - [React](https://dsci-554.github.io/react-example) : [Github](https://github.com/dsci-554/react-example)
4. A link to a video demonstration on YouTube. The video should introduce and demonstrate the project. This video should aim to captivate a conference audience and clearly communicate the system's purpose, functionality, and potential impact.
5. A link to your overleaf project for writing the paper.

Students will present the paper to the class as if they were presenting at a conference session, effectively communicating the design choices, contributions, and findings and leverage the video to provide an overview of the dashboard or infographic they have built.

| **Category** | **Sophisticated (4-5 pts)** | **Competent (2-3 pts)** | **Needs Work (0-1 pts)** |
|--------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Clarity of Exposition** | The paper is exceptionally clear, concise, and logically organized. Language is professional and effectively communicates complex ideas. Figures, tables, and captions are well-integrated and enhance comprehension. | The paper is understandable but may lack conciseness or logical flow. Language is generally clear but may include minor issues. Figures and tables are present but may not fully support the text. | The paper is difficult to follow, poorly organized, and contains multiple unclear sentences. Figures and tables may be missing or confusing. |
| **Quality of References** | Relevant, high-quality references are used to support the project, providing strong connections to existing research. All references are properly cited in LNCS format. | References are present but may lack relevance or completeness. Some formatting errors are present. | References are minimal or inappropriate. Significant formatting errors are present, showing little attention to citation guidelines. |
| **System Design and Implementation** | The system design is thoroughly documented, with clear explanations of design choices, technical implementation, and system architecture. The system is functional, demonstrating a deep understanding of visualization principles and effective design strategies. | System design is adequately explained, though some choices or technical details may lack depth. The system is functional but may not fully demonstrate advanced visualization principles. | System design is unclear or incomplete, with limited explanation of technical choices. The system may lack functionality or fail to demonstrate effective visualization principles. |
| **Demonstration** | The demo effectively showcases the tool’s capabilities, clearly demonstrating core functionalities and user interactions. It is well-prepared and structured, allowing viewers to understand the system’s strengths and applications. | The demo showcases the main functionalities but may lack some clarity or completeness in showing all features. Viewers may not fully grasp the system’s potential impact or uses. | The demo is poorly organized, with unclear or incomplete presentation of features. Viewers are left with an incomplete understanding of the system's capabilities. |
| **Presentation** | The presentation is professional and engaging, with a clear overview of the project goals, key visualization techniques, and insights. The delivery is well-paced and helps communicate the significance of the work effectively. | The presentation covers essential points but may lack clarity or engagement. The pacing or structure might cause some loss of focus on the project’s main contributions. | The presentation is difficult to follow, lacks organization, and fails to effectively communicate key points. Delivery may be too fast, slow, or unclear. |
| **Video** | The video is concise and engaging, effectively highlighting the system’s purpose, features, and user experience. The narrative is clear, and visuals are used to captivate and explain. The video is less than 5 minutes in length. | The video introduces the system and demonstrates features, but may lack conciseness or clarity in some parts. It engages the audience but could improve its storytelling.  The video is longer than 5 minutes in length. | The video is unfocused or fails to clearly demonstrate system features and purpose. It may lack engagement, and the audience may struggle to understand the project’s goals. The video is significantly longer than 5 minutes in length. |
| **Development** | GIT is used well by all members of the team. Node.js, d3.js, Bootstrap, and one of React, Streamlit, or Vue.js are well utilized. Project setup, deployment, and code base (including presentation) are well documented in `README.md`, which also includes a comprehensive project summary. | GIT is not well used by all members of the team. Node.js, d3.js, Bootstrap, and one of React, Streamlit, or Vue.js are not fully utilized. Project setup, deployment, and code base documentation in `README.md` are present but lack detail and the project summary is incomplete. | GIT is not used by all members of the team. Node.js, d3.js, Bootstrap, and one of React, Streamlit, or Vue.js are missing. Project setup, deployment, and code base documentation are absent in `README.md`, and no project summary is included. |
